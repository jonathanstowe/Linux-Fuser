Linux::Fuser README
========================

This module attempts to provide some of the functionality of the Unix
command 'fuser' for use in Perl programs that might need to know whether
a file is opened by another process.

The way that it does this is highly OS dependent and I would be surprised
( but happily surprised ) if it proves to work on any other OS than Linux
from 2.2 onward -  If it is found to work on other platforms please do
contact the author and we will look at changing the name :) I would also
be grateful of any patches that might cause it to work on other OS.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module has no dependencies other than it will almost certainly only
work on a Linux system with a /proc filesystem compatible with the one
found with the 2.2.* kernel, there are some features that may become available
to new kernel versions.
